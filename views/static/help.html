	        <h3>What is Flash Volunteer?</h3> 
	            <p>Flash Volunteer is a new web-based engagement portal for volunteer service in Seattle. It allows users to find volunteer opportunities, as well as create their own volunteer events to support causes in their own neighborhood. Flash Volunteer was built by volunteers for volunteers and we hope you will use it frequently. </p>
	        </div>
	        
	        <div id="faq-how_does_site_work">
	        <h3>How does the site work?</h3>                
	            <p>After you create an account, Flash Volunteer allows you to manage all of your volunteer opportunities in one place. You can search for events, sign up for the ones you are interested in, invite your friends to join your Flash Team and even create your own volunteer events to address needs that are important to you and your neighbors. We also offer receipts, so you can get credit for service hours if you need them for school or work. </p>

	        <h3>What does it mean for Flash Volunteer to be in "beta"?</h3>                
	            <p>It means that we are still adding new features and fixing bugs. If you have any suggestions, send us feedback. Please be patient while we continue to improve Flash Volunteer!  </p>

	        <div id="faq-costs_of_fv">
	        <h3>Does it cost anything to use Flash Volunteer?</h3>

	        <div id="faq-where_fv_gets_events">
	        <h3>Where does Flash Volunteer get its volunteer events?</h3>                
	            <p>The majority of the events in the system are posted directly to Flash Volunteer by local nonprofits and Seattle residents. We also share events from <a href="http://www.allforgood.org">All for Good</a> to provide a wider variety of opportunities for our users. If you are interested in signing up for an event from All for Good, we will provide a direct link to the original post (so you can let the event host know you are interested) and also keep track of it for you in your Flash Volunteer account.  </p>

	        <h3>So, I can really create my own volunteer event?</h3>

	        	<p>Your Flash Team is a way for you to stay connected to your neighbors, friends and fellow volunteers. Following an event, you can add the volunteers you just met to your Flash Team and stay connected between events. It's another way to help build community and strengthen ties between volunteers, neighbors and friends. </p>
