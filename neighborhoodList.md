Goal: Want to carefully select our set of initial neighborhoods in the system. Aim for ~30 neighborhoods/regions.

Process: Check out how others have divided the seattle/king county region (e.g. king county, urbanspoon, libraries...). Cull the list (places not in greater seattle region), aggregate smaller regions.


# From Urbanspoon #

This is pulled from urbanspoon. The number is the number of restaurants in the area. Lets consolidate the list, and remove areas that fall outside our scope. And use the data from king county to help in that consolidation.
