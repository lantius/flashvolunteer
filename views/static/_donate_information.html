<br>To help us introduce the site to as many neighborhoods in Seattle as possible, we're going to need your help.</p>
  
<p>If you would like to make a secure donation to support Flash Volunteer, a registered 501(c)3 nonprofit, please click the Donate button!</p>

<p>In case you were wondering, here is what your generosity can help us accomplish:</p>
<ul class="bullets">
 <li>$25: Printed outreach materials to spread the word about what we are doing
(and you get a Flash Volunteer sticker and lapel pin as a thank you)</li>
 <li>$50: An entire outreach kit with stickers, postcards, banners and more
(you get a Flash Volunteer sticker and lapel pin)  
 <li>$100: Office supplies for an entire month
(you get a snazzy Flash Volunteer t-shirt, sticker, and lapel pin)</li>     
 <li>$250: One neighborhood outreach event (complete with Eva's extra special homemade Flash Lemonade!)
(you get a Flash Volunteer t-shirt, sticker, lapel pin and a virtual hug, plus the secret lemonade recipe)</li>
 <li>$500: One entire Version 2.0 feature (we'll send you a menu and you can pick which one you'd like to sponsor)
(you get a Flash Volunteer t-shirt, sticker, lapel pin, real hug, karma, and the excitement of using a new feature)</li>
 <li>$1000: Two new Version 2.0 features 
(you get recognition as a Flash Volunteer Sustaining Donor plus even better karma and our love. And of course the t-shirt, lapel pin and sticker)</li>
 <li>$2500: Three entire months(!) of website maintenance, "bug squashing" and general upkeep 
(you get recognition as a Flash Volunteer Sustaining Donor plus even better karma and even more love, and the t-shirt, lapel pin and sticker)</li>
 <li>$5000: If this were an IPO, you'd own the company. But since it's not, you'd keep us running for half a year!
(you get top recognition as a Flash Volunteer Sustaining Donor plus everthing else.)</li>
 </ul>
 
<p>Without your support, we'll have to trim our wicks and tighten our belts even further. 
Which isn't really possible, so I guess you're going to have to make a donation to support 
the future of community service in Seattle...and, eventually, the rest of the country (did I mention there 
is already interest to start branches in Los Angeles and Philadelphia?).</p>
 
<br><p>Thanks so much!</p>
<br>
<p>p.s. Flash Volunteer is a registered Washington State nonprofit corporation and can accept charitable donations from individual donors. We are currently awaiting notification of our 501(c)(3) status from the IRS. Once we receive that, all donations made after 3/15/09 will be tax-deductible.</p>
