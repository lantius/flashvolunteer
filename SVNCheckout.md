We use a [Subversion (SVN)](http://subversion.tigris.org/) code repository hosted on [Google code](http://code.google.com/p/flashvolunteer/).

Make sure that you have an [SVN client installed](Installation#Get_an_SVN_client.md).

## Download the code ##

Goto http://code.google.com/p/flashvolunteer/source/checkout and follow the directions. Note that your password is linked to on that page. It is **NOT** your google account password.

Note that if you plan on using the Eclipse IDE (as documented in the [Installation directions](Installation.md)), you may want to avoid checking out from the command line and instead [checking out the code from within Eclipse](WorkingInEclipse.md).

## Browsing the code / see recent changes ##

This is not part of the installation process, but if you want, you can browse the source code [here](http://code.google.com/p/flashvolunteer/source/browse/).

You can also see [recent project changes](http://code.google.com/p/flashvolunteer/source/list).
