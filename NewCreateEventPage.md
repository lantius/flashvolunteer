# Introduction #

Based on the results of our nonprofit CIs and feedback from users, this is a collection of suggestions for how a new iteration of our "Create an Event" page might look.


# Details #

1. "Create an Event" header should be changed to "Add a Volunteer Opportunity".

2. "Name" should be changed to "Opportunity Title".

3. Insert: checkbox for "This is an ongoing opportunity/volunteer position."

4. Insert: checkbox for "This is a one-time opportunity."

If "ongoing" box is checked, then:
5. "Start/Date Time" should be changed to "I want this opportunity to disappear on" then drop-down calendar.

If "one-time" is checked, then:
6. "Start Date/Time" should be changed to "Opportunity Date" then proceed to "Start Time" and "End Time" drop-down menus.

7. "Neighborhood" drop-down: create button that asks "Add additional neighborhood?" If clicked, we provide another neighborhood drop-down menu and another "Add additional neighborhood" button.

8. Expand address section: Separate boxes for "Street Address", "City", "State" and "Zip Code".

9. "Contact email" is good. We should add button that asks: "Add another contact email?" If clicked, then provide another contact email box.

10. "Description" revised to "Opportunity Description".

11. Create drop down menu for categories with note to "select all that apply".


Questions:

1. How do we add tags (skills, categories, neighborhoods, etc.)?
2. Do we want to add tags?
