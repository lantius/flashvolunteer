# Reporting a Bug #

flashvolunteer uses Google Code for issue tracking.

If you get a bug, go here:
http://code.google.com/p/flashvolunteer/issues/entry

You will be prompted to enter the details for a new issue.  The most important thing for getting a bug fixed is the ability to reproduce the bug.  There are only a few things you need to do to help us with this:

  1. Use a clear summary.  Good: "Displays error when attempting to add an event volunteer".  Bad: "Doesn't work"
  1. Put in the steps that you used to get the bug.  If you have tried twice and received the same bug, note that as well.  Be sure to include the web address (URL at the top of the screen) for the page that gives you the error.
  1. If you get an error message, paste the complete text that shows up on the screen.
